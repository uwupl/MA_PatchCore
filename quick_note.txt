- backbones 
    - new class, that handles all the complexity regarding the backbone
    - All WideResNets, all normal ResNets
    - ConvNext --> no improvement at all
    - RN18 really good for 'own', only using 2nd Layer, but only ok on MVTechAD (e.g. 'pill' ca. 82% acc)
    - feature selection based on entropy does not work with every backbone, e.g. RN18 does work really well with low std features! (128 --> 16 with improvement!)
    - pruning of output_layer completed
- numba
    - total embedding process in numba (in progress)
    - calc score in numba
- productivity hacks
    - seperated files for backbone & dataset_utilities
    - using CUDA for train and not for test, speeds up kcenter_greedy a lot
    - dev of "test bench" (in progress)
- search
    - new faiss method for improved speed
    - KNN version adapted for cpu
- calc img level score
    - adapted version
    - does not only take into account NN, but k NNs!
    - also takes into account several patches
    - improves robustness with small coreset, also acc in most cases
- quantization
    - does not work with cpu...
    - not found any workarounds yet
    - most forum posts suggest that there is no performance improvement, bcs CPU is not optimized for fp16 operations, but for fp32!
